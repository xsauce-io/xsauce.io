Welcome to Xsauce! 

Xsauce is an ecosystem of three tools that merge fashion, collectibles, and various other cultural assets with blockchain technology.

The Xchange allows staked token holders to swap their staked Sauce token for synthetic tokens pegged to the value of real-world fashion items.(Synthetix + Sneakers) 

The Xvault is used in combination with the Xchange for those who would like less risk and want to earn a passive yield. (OlympusDAO with lower APY)

The Xhibit is a fully detailed marketplace that allows our community to purchase real-world assets at a discounted price. This is only accessible if you have met the specific utilization requirements of other apps in the ecosystem. (overstock.com)

Our immediate focus is on hyped or rare sneakers as they represent a unique cultural asset class. Further to this point, sneakers have become a lucrative investment as evidenced through the rapidly growing $10 billion+ sneaker resale market.

We believe that the future of cultural assets will be dynamic. That the value created will grow in tandem with the meaning and creativity which defines culture. We see a future where a select number of assets are released for physical wear/use and the remaining are synthetic counterparts.
